**Locked** is a web application designed as a practical add-on for **ControlD** users. It makes it easy to manage access to sites blocked or unblocked by **ControlD DNS**, while providing additional security information for each domain. To use this project you need a **ControlD subscription**.

# Features

- **Fast domain blocking and unblocking**: add or remove domains from your ControlD block lists with a single click.
- **ControlD subscription overview**: quickly view the number of days remaining on your ControlD subscription.
- **Security information**: view domain security information directly from the block/unblock page. This information is provided by VirusTotal via a personal API key.

# How does it work?

When **ControlD** blocks a site, a customised blocking page is displayed (if this option is enabled in ControlD). Locked integrates directly with this page to provide a simplified management experience:

- **Instant unblocking**: Locked interacts with the ControlD API to unblock the site instantly. This feature enables access to be restored quickly while maintaining visibility of the site's security information.

- **Fast blocking**: as well as unblocking, the Locked application can also block a site in a matter of seconds. Simply enter the URL of a domain in the Locked interface to add it to the ControlD blocking lists.

- **ControlD subscription tracking**: in Locked, users can quickly see information about their ControlD subscription, including the number of days remaining.

Locked transforms the management of blocked and unblocked sites into a simple, secure and efficient process.
